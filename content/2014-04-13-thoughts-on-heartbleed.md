A few days ago there was some shocking news: it turned out that OpenSSL contained a bug that allowed an individual to read up to 64KB of memory stored on the server that runs OpenSSL. While the exploit itself is very interesting, I won't be discussing it here. You can read a more detailed description of the bug at http://heartbleed.com.

A day or so later, the word got out that the NSA had been using this bug for over two years (since its inception) to spy on the usual suspects - banks, foreign governments, etc. 

Somehow I felt unmoved by this supposed "fact". By now we know that the NSA has been doing this kind of shit for years on end. Why should I care more about the NSA using this exploit than any other zero-day they're using? 

At the same time, when I discuss these new findings with friends / other random internet strangers I see the same kind of attitude ("It's really bad / but we can't do anything about it / I don't really care anymore"). It's the same thing that happens again and again when something big happens and you get trampled by the news about it for months. And this, quite frankly, is starting to scare me. 

The same thing happend with Ed Snowden - when he first leaked the first documents, the world was turned upside down for at least a few months. Investigations were started, statements were made, protests were held. Nothing changed (drastically).

So I wonder, what is the correct attitude towards these things? I know I can't do anything against it (i.e. politics) directly, so should I just not care anymore? Should I be out on the streets protesting? Is there a middle ground in all this? I don't want to be the guy that doesn't care - but there's no sense in shutting myself off the internet either, so to speak.
