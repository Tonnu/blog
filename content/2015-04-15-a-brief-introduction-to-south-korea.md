So we left. No expectations. 

Six weeks is a long time it turns out! Here's a (maybe not so) brief recap of what we experienced.

**The good, the bad & the ugly**


Imagine this: a tall guy & a blond girl setting their first steps in Asia. They probably look at least somewhat confused, but mostly they're just exited. "*How the f@ck do we know where we're going if we can't read any signs?*" Turns out: you don't. 

Well, then there was Dylan. We looked even more confused when he started talking to us with an American accent. "So you guys backpacking? Cool."
Dylan brought us up to speed with some Korean culture and things to do in Seoul. "You gotta try chicken & cheese man, it's so good." (We did, some time later. It's really good. Thank you Dylan :-))

Fast forward few days: we're tired & jetlagged, sleeping 12+ hours a day. So while hanging out in our hostel (Ultari Guesthouse - really recommmend those guys. Right in Hongdae which is the hip area to be in Seoul) we bumped into not one, not two, not three but probably like 5 people from Singapore that were also staying there. 

One of the guys, Royston, told us he'd been to Korea a couple of times and he loved to come here. "The food is just so good! I always call it 'Kimchi land.' Did you guys try Soju yet?" We had not, in fact. Soju, for us was still that mysterious-looking green-bottled alocohol. So Royston was kind enough to introduce us to Soju. And Soju with beer, or "Soju Bombs". Little did we know, that was the start of a curious night.
