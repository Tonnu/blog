I like to think that programmers are going to play an increasingly important role in our society. Modern cars, for example, are essentially no more than driving computers. Coffee machines can already be controlled from the internet. Social media has become an integral part of our society. Rockets are continually being sent into space. But not only are physical products going digital, also the way we buy these products. Bitcoin is a new form of currency – its money that exists only virtually. It allows everyone to trade money peer-to-peer: from one person to another, without the need for a bank to handle the transaction. But behind all this, developers play a key part in realizing these ideas.

### Start-ups

Traditionally, these developers have worked for big companies, such as Microsoft, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and IBM, to name a few. These companies used to be the most innovative companies in the world. From creating Windows, to the first smartphone and tablet – everyone wanted to work for them.

But times are changing, and young developers are not that keen on working for these “veteran” companies anymore. Instead, more and more programmers are joining small, young companies dubbed “start-ups” with often only 2-5 people working there. As Paul Graham, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley argues in his essay “Creating Wealth”, it’s because these start-ups are so small that they gain the advantage of developing faster with less money and with less hassle. The result: more innovation.

But let’s not forget that the veterans are still major players in the tech world. They have simply become too big and therefore too slow to be able to keep up with small teams in start-ups. They are like the big bully, trying to chase the small, but fast kid that jumps over fences to shake him off. And thus, when looking for innovation, people are starting to turn to the start-ups instead of the veterans.

### Innovation in the U.S versus The Netherlands

What I’m describing here is primarily a trend in the U.S. It’s there that college students and recent graduates (the same people running the start-ups) realize that to bring change to the world, you have to take matters into your own hands. It’s not a novel idea by any means, but when I compare that mindset to the mindset we have here in The Netherlands, I am quite disappointed.

I‘m disappointed because the majority of people here – including universities – are still under the impression that in order to achieve some kind of success, you should simply go to college and get a degree. I think that that’s a big flaw in our thought-process and very old fashioned. In my opinion, the people building our future are not benefitting from traditional teaching anymore (i.e. take a course, pass the exam).

I think it’s very important that our future programmers become more aware of the fact that it’s not absolutely necessary anymore to have a degree. Once it becomes embedded in our culture that college is not the de facto standard anymore, a lot of young people will get more motivated to take matters into their own hands (like in the U.S).

### Take better care of soon-to-be programmers

In the end, schools should inspire these young developers to build our future. Schools should change their traditional, current methods of teachings to reflect the issues that really matter these days. And rather than preparing them to disappear in a big firm, they should be inspired to develop their unique contribution that this world is asking for these days. Only then will The Netherlands be able to compete in the innovation race.
