For the last couple of weeks I've been really starting to pick up on webdev. Below you'll find my thoughts as to what I've learned about what it means to develop for the web these days. 


#### The status Quo
The first thing I thought when looking for modern-day technologies, frameworks for developing webapps was _holy shit there's a lot of everything_. To prove my point, here's an overview of what I found:

* Twitter's Boostrap (front-end framework geared towards templating)
* Google's AngularJS (front-end MVC framework geared towards data-binding & dependency injection)
* NodeJS (Server-side Javascript)
* Yeoman (Application scaffolding)
* Coffeescript (Abstraction language for Javascript)
* SASS (Easier and better CSS)
* Phaser (HTML5 game-engine)

Truth be told, I was feeling seriously overwhelmed with possibilities. Last time I was doing some programming for the web I was using... well, HTML, Javascript and CSS. 

#### Oh god, it's everywhere!
Javascript that is. At least, it looks that way. Even more so because all of my classes in college teach me Java. Java for Desktop apps (I know, I was as shocked as you are), Java for Enterprise Applications and Java for the web. It was JSF (*Java Server Faces*) galore. Oh, and CDI (Context & Dependency Injection) containers, too.

And frankly, all this Java stuff feels extremely irrelevant after trying out some Node and AngularJS. If you want to get a feeling for making a Java webapp, take a look at my "Kwetter" Github repo. It's a project for a class I'm taking where I'm supposed to build a Twitter clone. I'm going to put up a start to my Reddit clone in AngularJS soon, so there will be a nice comparison available. 

#### But is it any good?
After working with JSF I'd say **yes, yes yes!** I'm not saying JSF (and the other Java implementations) don't serve their purpose. Quite the contrary, I think it's a good option for a rock-solid backend. Plus, I havn't even scratched the surface of what NodeJS has to offer. I'm really exited to get a complete app up & running so I can get a better feel for this webdev world dominated by Javascript.
